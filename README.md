# 📚 BookBot

**BookBot** is a simple Python project that analyzes a `.txt` file (like a book or document) and prints:
- Total word count
- Frequency of each alphabetic character (a–z)

This is a great beginner-level project to learn file handling, dictionaries, sorting, and basic CLI usage.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Takes a `.txt` file path as a command-line argument.
2. Reads the entire content of the file.
3. Analyzes the text:
   - Counts all words
   - Counts each character
4. Prints a clean report with results.
